# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a simple browser-based Etch-a-Sketch application that lets users draw by hovering or clicking over a grid of cells. It is a fun way to replicate the classic toy while practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this project was to enhance my DOM manipulation skills and solidify my understanding of front-end development.

## Features
- Drawing Modes:
    - Sketch Mode (default): Gradually darkens the cell with each hover or click.
    - Rainbow Mode: Changes the cell color to a random color on hover or click.
- Grid Resolution Control: A slider lets you adjust the grid size dynamically (from 4x4 to 64x64).
- Clear Button: Resets the drawing board to start over.
- Responsive grid that adjusts cell size automatically based on the resolution.

## Why I Built This Project
The main purpose of this project was to:

- Practice building interactive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Gain hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamically updating elements.
- Work on creating responsive layouts and controls.

### Accomplishments
- Successfully implemented interactive drawing functionality with hover and click events.
- Added a dynamic grid resizing feature using a slider and ensured cells scale appropriately.
- Created multiple drawing modes to add variety to the application.
- Built a clean and functional layout for the UI using basic CSS.

### Areas for Improvement
While the project is functional, there are areas that could be improved:

- Performance: Drawing on larger grids (e.g., 64x64) can feel a bit slow or unresponsive, especially when dragging the cursor.
- UI Design: The current design is simple and effective but could be made more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Additional Features: Adding features like an eraser tool, color picker, or saving the drawing would make the application more robust.
